# GIS Portfolio – Karol Pietruszka

I am a GIS and geospatial analysis specialist with a solid background in forestry and spatial data management. After completing the UNIGIS program in Geographic Information Systems at Jagiellonian University, I combined academic knowledge with over 7 years of hands-on experience in spatial data processing, remote sensing (including LiDAR), and map production for forest inventory projects.

I am currently seeking new opportunities to contribute to projects focused on spatial analysis, cartography, or geospatial intelligence—particularly those related to environmental, ecological, or infrastructure domains.

My skill set includes proficiency in ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, LiDAR data processing, map automation, and foundational Python and SQL programming. I bring strong attention to detail, the ability to work independently or collaboratively, and a genuine passion for nature, maps, and technology.
📍 Based in Vienna  
🌍 Open to **remote** and **on-site** work opportunities
